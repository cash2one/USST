# Universal Streamer Subscribing Tool (USST)
======================

With new streaming platforms rising, panda.tv etc., streamers are distributed in different platforms, which cause audiences to switch between platforms in order to see what they want.
Such switching always cost plenty of time. This tool helps solving this problems by:

1. Allow users to get the information of all streamers he is interested with one request.
2. Extensible structure which allows quick adjustment to new platforms.

Currently, four platforms are supported: `douyu`, `panda`, `zhanqi`, `longzhu`.

## Current situation

The tool is still under construction, and it may takes a few weeks to finish it.

## TODO

1. Write the scrapping process of different platforms
2. Set up the url
3. Make it runnable
4. Apply PEP8 coding style
5. Write tests
6. Write manage script
7. Add Travis CI
8. Make setup easy
9. Write client tool to control settings.py
10. Browser plugins to control settings.py
11. .......
